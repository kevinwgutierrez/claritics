# claritics

# Summary
This is a mobile application that I built in React Native which aims to provide a platform for users to get their political information.

# The Idea Behind It:
## Clarity + Politics

Let's face it. It's hard to navigate the modern political realm. Problems such as determining which sites are biased and what information is the truth is increasingly difficult. The idea behind CLaritics is to provide an outlet that helps alleviate these issues for the common citizen. A one stop shop to finding out what you want to know as a citizen.
